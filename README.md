Slickplate Square Black
=======================

A simple and clean HTML5 website template in the style of [about.me](http://about.me "about.me") using [Backstretch](http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/ "Backstretch") to embed a full-size background image that fades in after loading and automatically resizes itself.
Demo
--------
See a live demo running [here](http://kwiat.github.com/slickplate-square-black "Slickplate Demo").

Usage
--------
1. Just follow the comments or search for "your" in index.html and quickly replace example content with your own name and links.
2. Drop a background photo (landscape works best) as bg.jpg into the /img folder.
3. If you want to add web tracking, please do not forget to insert your personal tracking code.
4. Upload everything to your web server. That's it!
