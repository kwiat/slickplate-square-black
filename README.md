Slickplate Square Black
=======================

A simple and clean HTML5 website template in the style of [about.me](http://about.me "about.me") using [Backstretch](http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/ "Backstretch") to embed a full-size background image that fades in after loading and automatically resizes itself.

Usage
--------
1. Just follow the comments or search for "your" in index.html and quickly replace example content with your own name and links.
2. Then drop a lovely portrait of yours (landscape works best) as bg.jpg into the /img folder.
3. If you want to add web tracking, please do not forget to insert your [tracking code](http://support.google.com/googleanalytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=55603 "Where can I find my tracking code").
4. Upload everything to your web server. That's it!
