Slickplate Square Black
=======================

A simple and clean HTML5 website template in the style of [about.me](http://about.me "about.me") using [Backstretch](http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/ "Backstretch")
 to embed a full-size background image that fades in after loading.

Usage
--------
Just follow the comments or search for "your" in index.html and quickly replace example content with your own name and content. Then drop a lovely portrait of yours as bg.jpg into /img and upload everything to your webserver.
